This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Where the memes at
You can start your search at `src/App.tsx` to see what contexts / HOCs are necessary for a lot of these state management solutions to work.

## More specifically
- Good Redux: `src/features/counter/`
- Lazy Redux: `src/features/ReduxCounter/ReduxCounter.tsx`
- Zustand: `src/features/ZustandCounter/ZustandCounter.tsx`
- Recoil: `src/features/RecoilCounter/RecoilCounter.tsx`
- React hooks: `src/features/ContextCounter/ContextCounter.tsx`
